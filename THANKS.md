Thanks to Atrox for the idea and leading the charge in title generation for Dart with their package Haikunator.
Their package is no longer supported on Pub and has not been updated since 2018, so I decided to create a package
with similar functionality for use in DartPad. You can find their 
project [on Github](https://github.com/Atrox/haikunatordart).

Thanks to all current and future contributors as well, whether it's for code improvements or for noun and attributive
suggestions!
